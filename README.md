[![Continuous Integration (linux/macOS/windows)](https://github.com/dcoeurjo/transport-optimal-gdrigrv-11-2020/workflows/Continuous%20Integration%20(linux/macOS/windows)/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dcoeurjo/transport-optimal-gdrigrv-11-2020/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Continuous+Integration+%28linux%2FmacOS%2Fwindows%29%22)

This project contains the code and notes of the first [Ecole de recherche du GDR IG-RV](https://transpopt-igrv.sciencesconf.org) on numerical optimal transport (2-6/11/2020). 

More precisely, we propose three differnet c++ or python exercices:
 * [Color Transfer via Discrete Optimal Transport using the sliced approach](https://codimd.math.cnrs.fr/s/2eRBqV9zl)
 * Regularized Convolutional Wasserstein Barycenters -WIP-
 * Uniform Sampling Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport -WIP-

Each exercice is quite self-contained and independent. For each one, we provide the essential starting kit (`c++` and `python`). For any question, please discuss with us through the Discrod Channel (see below).
